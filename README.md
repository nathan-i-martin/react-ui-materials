> <h3>Logic - Overview</h3>
Imagine, you work at a company that makes door mats. As the head of design,
your job is to decide on various items related to how a mat will look.
You decide the texture and color. You decide on if you want to have a thick
seem around the end or if the corners should be rounded.

In RUM, your thought process should follow this same mindset. RUM was designed to allow
UI developers more flexibility when designing elements. These elements should be able
to be easily added to a project without the need to spend hours perfecting a stylesheet.

> <h3>Mats</h3>
RUM centers around the idea of mats. Mats as in, floor-mats.

Just like real world mats.
Mats created with RUM are able to contain text, images, and other content. They can also have various properties such as:
<ul>
    <li>Material</li>
    <li>Shape</li>
</ul>

> <h3>Material</h3>
Materials are the star of RUM. By defining what material a mat is comprised of, you can easily change the textures and feelings of your UI.
